# MathTools Python

As a Python beginner, I started this project to create a better console calculator than the "How to code console calculator" tutorials which are taking only 2 inputs and working with "if-else" conditions. After finalizing the basic math operations. I want to add more tools. And that is why I named this project "MathTools"..

The second reason is to "help" the other Python developers by giving this idea. To make try this project and create more advanced math programs. Then, It will help the others to do more and more. And finally, to have something to do while my free time. This is why the project development is slow and have too much commits.

This calculator can do operations with infinite numbers. You can add 5+10+15... instead of doing firstNum = 4, secondNum = 2, 4+2 = 6. It's already better than nothing üòè.

## Usage/Examples
